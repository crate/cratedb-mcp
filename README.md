# About
Model Context Protocol [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a protocol that standardizes providing
context to LLMs like Claude, ChatGPT and MistralAI.

CrateDB MCP server lets these LLMs operate directly on CrateDB enabling use cases like:

- Answer questions about your data and database state
- Help you debug and optimize queries directly on the database

To use a MCP server you need a [client that supports] the protocol, the most notable ones are:
Claude Desktop, ChatGTP desktop, OPenAI agents SDK and Cursor.

# Examples
For questions like optimizing queries and CrateDB specific syntax/capabilities, we encourage the
LLMs to fetch `https://cratedb.com/docs` to offer the most accurate possible information.

These are examples of questions that have been tested and validated by the team. Remember that
LLMs can still hallucinate and give incorrect answers.

* Optimize this query: "SELECT * FROM movies WHERE release_date > '2012-12-1' AND revenue"
* Tell me about the health of the cluster
* What is the storage consumption of my tables, give it in a graph.
* How can I format a timestamp column to '2019 Jan 21'.

# Data integrity
We do not recommend letting the LLMs insert data or modify columns by itself, as such we tell the
LLMs to only allow 'SELECT' statements in the `cratedb_sql` tool, you can jailbreak this against
our recommendation.

# Install
```shell
uv pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/crate/cratedb-mcp
```

# Configure
```shell
export CRATEDB_MCP_HTTP_URL=https://example.aks1.westeurope.azure.cratedb.net:4200
```

# Usage
Start MCP server with `stdio` transport (default).
```shell
CRATEDB_MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio uv run cratedb-mcp
```
Start MCP server with `sse` transport.
```shell
CRATEDB_MCP_TRANSPORT=sse uv run cratedb-mcp
```

# Simple Claude configuration
To use the MCP version within Claude Desktop, you can use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my_cratedb": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--python", "3.10", "--from", "git+https://github.com/crate/cratedb-mcp", "cratedb-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CRATEDB_MCP_HTTP_URL": "http://localhost:4200/",
        "CRATEDB_MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You might have to change `CRATEDB_MCP_HTTP_URL` to match your CrateDB instance.


NB: You can use `uv tool install` to install the program "system"-wide,
so you can use it across your terminal or Claude sessions. In this case,
omit the `uv run` prefix displayed above.
