## MCP tool instructions

Use all available tools from the CrateDB MCP server `cratedb-mcp` for accurate information.

You have the following tools available:
1. `get_table_metadata`: Return column schema and metadata for all tables stored in CrateDB. Use it to inquire entities you don't know about.
2. `query_sql`: Execute SQL query on CrateDB and return results.
3. `get_cratedb_documentation_index`: Returns the table of contents for the CrateDB documentation. If in doubt about CrateDB-specific syntax, you can obtain the documentation here.
4. `fetch_cratedb_docs`: Once a specific link within the CrateDB documentation is identified, you can download its content here by providing the link.

Try to reason and give an interpretation of the result.
